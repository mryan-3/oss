# Troubleshooting

## Common Issues

### "Expected JSON content type" Error

```
Error: Expected JSON content type, got: multipart/form-data
```

**Solution:** Make sure you're using the uploadthing client utilities (`uploadFiles`, `useUploadThing`) instead of raw `fetch` calls with `FormData`.

### CORS Issues

```
Access to fetch at 'http://localhost:8001/api/uploadthing' from origin 'http://localhost:3000' has been blocked by CORS policy
```

**Solution:** Configure CORS properly on your Express server:

```typescript
import cors from 'cors'

app.use(cors({
  origin: process.env.FRONTEND_URL,
  credentials: true
}))
```

### File Size Limits

If you're getting "File too large" errors:

1. Check your client-side configuration:
```typescript
f({
  image: {
    maxFileSize: "4MB", // Adjust as needed
    maxFileCount: 1
  }
})
```

2. Verify your server's payload limits:
```typescript
app.use(express.json({ limit: '10mb' }))
app.use(express.urlencoded({ extended: true, limit: '10mb' }))
```

### Authentication Issues

If uploads are failing with 401/403 errors:

1. Check your UploadThing token in environment variables
2. Verify your authentication middleware:

```typescript
.middleware(async ({ req }) => {
  const user = await validateUser(req)
  if (!user) throw new Error('Unauthorized')
  return { userId: user.id }
})
```

## Best Practices

### Security
- Always validate file types both client and server-side
- Implement proper authentication in middleware
- Use environment variables for sensitive configuration
- Set appropriate file size limits

### Performance
- Show upload progress indicators
- Implement retry logic for failed uploads
- Consider image compression for large files
- Use appropriate chunk sizes for large files

### Error Handling
- Implement proper error boundaries in React components
- Handle network errors gracefully
- Provide clear error messages to users
- Log errors properly for debugging

## Debugging Tips

### Client-Side
- Check browser console for detailed error messages
- Inspect network requests in browser dev tools
- Verify correct endpoint URLs
- Check file size and type restrictions

### Server-Side
- Enable detailed logging
- Verify environment variables
- Check server logs for error messages
- Test endpoints with tools like Postman
