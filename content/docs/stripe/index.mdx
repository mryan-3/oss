# Stripe Integration

This guide covers the implementation of Stripe payment processing for subscription and one-time payments. The system supports:
- Subscription-based payments with different plan tiers
- One-time payments (e.g., VIP purchases)
- Webhook handling for real-time payment updates
- Database synchronization
- Secure payment processing

## Architecture

```typescript
project/
├── src/
│   ├── controllers/    # Payment handling logic
│   ├── middleware/     # Stripe webhook verification
│   ├── models/        # Database models
│   └── utils/         # KV store and helpers
└── .env              # Environment configuration
```
